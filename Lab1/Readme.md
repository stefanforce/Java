# Laboratory1

For this laboratory, I have done the following:

For the first exercise I have done most of the tasks required in the "Java part" directory of Github, except for functionality for the "sync" parameter, which only works using its "true" value.

For the second exercise I have used the python program in the "Python part" directory of Github. It used urllib to invoke the java servlet using python.

I have not done the 3rd exercise as I couldn't finish the first task about sync.
